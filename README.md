This Repository **Homelab** contains all my homelab documentation files. Here you'll find notes, setups, and configurations for infrastructure, applications, networking, and more.

> :warning: Be aware, products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this wonâ€™t always be the case.

I created them as free resources to be used in your specific use cases. If you're searching for detailed, in-depth tutorials on some tools or technologies, check out my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@christianlempa).

## Contribution
